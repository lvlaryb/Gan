# Mabul Pipeline

> A marketing and documentation site for an AI-driven development workflow — four specialized agents (Product, Design, Engineering, Security) collaborate to take a feature idea from brief to shipped code.

## What it does

Mabul Pipeline presents a multi-agent AI workflow where four named personas — each with a distinct responsibility — handle software delivery end-to-end. Work is routed across three tracks depending on complexity: a full product → design → dev → security pass, a fast track for bug fixes, or a standalone security audit. The site showcases the concept, documents each agent's capabilities, and tracks live Claude API token usage in the navbar.

## Engineering highlights

- **Multi-agent orchestration model** — four personas (Noah, Naamah, Shem, Nehemiah) with explicit role contracts and track-based routing logic (A/B/C), documented as reusable Claude Code skills
- **Live API telemetry** — `/api/token-count` reads `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL logs at request time and surfaces aggregated token usage without a database or polling loop
- **Design system as code** — all spacing, color, and typography live as CSS custom properties in `globals.css`; components consume only tokens, no hardcoded values, enforced by a `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` spec
- **Accessibility-first** — ARIA roles and labels throughout, 44×44px touch targets, visible focus rings, and `prefers-reduced-motion` support on all animated elements
- **Strong typing** — every component has a co-located `.types.ts` file; no `any` types; props and API shapes are fully typed with TypeScript 5

## Architecture

```
src/
  app/
    page.tsx              # Homepage: Hero, Personas, Discord banner
    skills/page.tsx       # Skills catalog + Pipeline Flow diagram
    api/token-count/      # Claude JSONL log aggregation endpoint
    globals.css           # Design system tokens (single source of truth)
  components/
    Navbar/               # Token counter integrated into nav
    Hero/ Features/ Footer/
    SkillCard/ PipelineFlow/ Personas/
    icons/                # SVG components (typed, 16×18px)
docs/
  DESIGN_SYSTEM.md        # Full token & pattern reference
```

Each component lives in its own folder with a CSS Module and a TypeScript types file. State is minimal and local — no Redux or Zustand; the UI is driven by typed constants. Dark theme only, with elevation expressed through background-color layers rather than box shadows.
